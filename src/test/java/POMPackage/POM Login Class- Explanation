As shown in the code, the POMLogin class represents a login page of a web application. It has three methods: typeUsername(), typePassword(), and clickloginButton(), which represent the actions that can be performed on the login page. The @FindBy class is used to specify the element locator (e.g., NAME, CSS, etc.) and store value for each web element on the page. The WebDriverWait class is used to wait for the web elements to be visible before performing actions on them, ensuring that the web page is fully loaded before interacting with it. Any changes to the web application's UI can be easily reflected by updating its corresponding Page Object class, rather than updating multiple places in the test scripts.
