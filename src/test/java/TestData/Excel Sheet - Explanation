Parameterization is a powerful technique in test automation that allows to execute the same test case with different sets of data. We can use an Excel sheet as a data source for parameterization in Selenium. The code shows an example of how we can read data from an Excel sheet and use it in Selenium tests using the Apache POI library.
As shown in the code, we use the Apache POI library to read data from an Excel sheet (LoginDetails.xlsx) that contains username and password values. The @DataProvider annotation is used to provide the test data to the test method Login(). The test method takes two parameters (username and password) which are supplied by the data provider. The test method then uses these parameters to perform the login operation in the web page.
